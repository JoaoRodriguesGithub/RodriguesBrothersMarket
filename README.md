On this final class project was proposed to be developed program that simulates a supermarket management system in C# programming language:

The main goals for the project were:
-	Should exist a login and add collaborator
-	Should exist various types of collaborators
-	All should do login 
-	Only the manager should be able to delete other collaborators
-	Only the replenisher can add new products to stock
-	Only Cashier or manager can sell
-	Should exist a list of products in stock
-	It can only be sold products that exists in stock
-	Selling process should show a menu with products, if possible, show first the categories of products and then the products of that category.
-	The sell ends when the user chooses the option “0”.
-	Should be possible to add new products to the stock.
-	Clear stock.
-	Remove a single product from a list.
-	Invoice should show bought products, collaborator name who sold, customer name.
-	Invoice should be possible to show total cost, but this must not be stored but calculated by products.
-	Should be possible to organize the list but total value and show on console with the customer’s name.
-	At minimum should be stored current stock on file, but ideally all invoices and collaborators
